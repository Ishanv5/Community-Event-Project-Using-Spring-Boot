# Community-Event-Project-Using-Spring-Boot

Creating a Community Event Management System using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL involves several steps. Here's a high-level outline of the project:
1. Project Setup
Tools and Technologies

    Backend: Spring Boot
    Frontend: Thymeleaf, Bootstrap
    Database: MySQL
    IDE: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
    Build Tool: Maven or Gradle

2. Project Structure
Maven/Gradle Project Setup

Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr with dependencies:

    Spring Web
    Spring Data JPA
    MySQL Driver
    Thymeleaf
    Spring Security (optional for authentication)

3. Database Design
Tables

    Users: for user authentication and roles.
    Events: to store event details.
    RSVPs: to track user registrations for events.

Example Schema

sql

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE events (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_by INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (created_by) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE rsvps (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    event_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES events(id)
);

4. Backend Development
Entities

Create JPA entities for User, Event, and RSVP.
Repositories

Create repositories for the entities to handle database operations.
